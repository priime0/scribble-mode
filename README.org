#+title: scribble-mode

=scribble-mode= is a major mode for editing [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/][scribble]] documentation files from the [[https://racket-lang.org/][Racket]] programming language. This is a fork of the [[https://github.com/emacs-pe/scribble-mode][emacs-pe/scribble-mode]] package.

This package adds:

 * Syntax-highlighting for scribble constructs and keywords
 * Keybinds for interacting with and inserting Scribble constructs faster (think auctex for scribble)

** Keybinds

 * =C-c C-d= adds a /datum/ from a completion. This includes titles, sections, items, etc. You can add more datums by modifying =scribble-mode-collection=: ~(add-to-list 'scribble-mode-collection '(example "@example{" "}"))~.
 * =C-c C-j= inserts a new =@item=.
